class Minesweeper:
    def __init__(self, tk_root, difficulty):
        self.difficulty = difficulty
        self.tk = tk_root
        self.frame = tk.Frame(self.tk)
        self.frame.pack()

        # ... (rest of your code)

def main():
    window = tk.Tk()
    window.title("Minesweeper")
    minesweeper = Minesweeper(tk_root=window, difficulty="hard")
    window.mainloop()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
The key change is to use tk_root instead of tk to avoid confusion with the module name tkinter. This way, you're passing the Tk instance as tk_root to your Minesweeper class constructor. This should resolve the import error.
